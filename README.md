<h1> Aarogyam Care </h1>

## Inspiration
I had my childhood in a village and that makes me feel the problems faced by the people in the rural areas. Today, we focussed on the following problems:
<ul>
 <li>Lack of diagnosis of health-related problems in rural</li>
<li>Lack of information about Government Schemes</li>
<li>Less awareness on health camps</li>
<li>No platform to share remedial ideas</li> 
</ul>


## What it does
Focussing on the problems, we designed the following solution:
<ul>
<li>In-App diagnosis</li>
<li>Government Schemes and Health Camp Notification</li>
<li>Healthcare Bot to answer FAQs</li>
<li>Platform to share home remedies</li>
  </ul>

## How we built it
We built it using technologies like Flutter and Firebase to implement the functionality of the app.

## Challenges we ran into
We ran through many challenges, firstly it's designing the right solution to the given problem statement. Other than these, we faced some challenges to make our app bug free and implementing simple UI so that people in rural areas can easily use it.
## Accomplishments that we're proud of
Designing a solution and that too for the rural people is itself a challenging task. Making things happen is our biggest achievement.
 
## What we learned
We learned much functionality in the tech that we used, apart from that we learned time management.

## What's next for Aarogyam Care
We have a list of ideas to implement in the future:
<ul>
<li>Multi-language support</li>
<li>Verifying app with doctors reviews</li>
<li>Integrating doctors platform</li>
<li>Voice command bot</li>
<li>Using Ar to teach precautions, first-aid and initial stage treatment</li>
 </ul>
